# Hygen templates

The templates in this directory are intended to be used with [hygen](https://www.hygen.io/) to generate boilerplate files. Check out [the root package.json](../package.json) to see if there are any custom commands to use them (e.g. `npm run playground:new`). You can also run e.g. `hygen playground new` to use a generator.

Some helpful docs links for updating/creating templates:

- [enquirer](https://github.com/enquirer/enquirer#toggle-prompt) for building command line prompts
- [inflection](https://www.hygen.io/docs/templates#helpers-and-inflections) and [change case](https://www.hygen.io/docs/templates#change-case-helpers) for e.g. changing the case of variables submitted via the prompts
